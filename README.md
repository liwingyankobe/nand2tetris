# nand2tetris - Building a Modern Computer From First Principles

This repository contains my original solutions to all the projects
in the famous course [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
It is a wonderful free course for introduction to computer architecture,
programming languages, operating system, and even algorithms.
The software hierarchy (assembler, VM translator, compiler) was done here in Python.

The solutions are for reference purpose only. Please do not copy any of
the solutions for your own submissions.

## Table of contents

1. Hardware implementation of common logic gates
2. Hardware implementation of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
3. Hardware implementation of register, RAM, and counter
4. Two simple programs written in assembly language
5. Hardware implementation of CPU, memory, and a basic computer
6. Assembler: translating the given assembly language into machine code
7. VM translator I: a partial VM translator supporting stack operations only
8. VM translator II: the complete VM translator supporting program flows and function calls
9. An application written in Jack (a Java-like simplified OOP language for this course)
    - I chose to write a [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulator
10. Compiler I: a parser for analyzing Jack source code
11. Compiler II: the complete compiler for translating Jack to VM code
12. A basic operating system supporting features like memory allocation and I/O
